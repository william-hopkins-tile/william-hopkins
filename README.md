# Who am I?
I'm a senior data engineer at Tile.

# Dotfiles
The /dotfiles directory contains my configuration dotfiles so that if I have to wipe my machine, I'll be able to get started again relatively easily.

There's something to be said for not relying too heavily on custom scripts with no backup. The solution? Git :P
