# Who am I?
I'm a senior data engineer at Tile.

# Dotfiles
The /dotfiles directory contains my configuration dotfiles so that if I have to wipe my machine, I'll be able to get started again relatively easily.

There's something to be said for not relying too heavily on custom scripts with no backup. The solution? Git :P

## Vundle
The Vundle directory doesn't actually contain files, because it's a git repo itself. However, I kept it as-is so that it's a list of the plugins I'm using.

# Keyboard layouts
I've built my own Corne LP and am on my way to a Ferris Sweep and Kyria. I've decided to start tracking my keyboard layouts here, so that I can easily get back to my current state without too much mucking about. At the present, I'm using QMK Toolbox so I'm just storing the hex files.
